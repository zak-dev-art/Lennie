⚙️ How It Works

The loading screen appears first with a filling progress bar.

When the loading completes, the main content fades in.

Confetti bursts across the screen, and background music begins playing.

The slideshow automatically rotates through your uploaded photos, each with a different caption.

After 57 seconds, a surprise message pop-up appears with another confetti effect.

A manual confetti button lets users trigger extra sparkles anytime.

🚀 How to Use

Clone or download the project folder.

Place all your image files and the music file in the same directory as index.html.

Open index.html in any modern browser.

Enjoy your digital birthday experience 🎉

💡 Tip: You can customize messages, captions, or timings by editing the script section at the bottom of index.html.

🎨 Customization Ideas

Change background colors or gradients in the <body> tag.

Replace the surprise message text with your own.

Adjust the slideshow timing (default = every 4 seconds).

Swap the music file with another .mp3 or .oga.

Add your own animations using Tailwind or small JS tweaks.
